# IFREMER hosted satellite data like that at
# ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/pub/ifremer/cersat/SAFOSI/Products/NARSST/netcdf/cana/2009/
# can be directly swallowed by Mirone. Since those files have no coordinates (despite
# the claim that they are COARDS compliant), you can provide the name of the netCDF
# file containing the coordinates of the tille being read.
# For that OBEY to the syntax bellow, where first word is a keyword and second the file name
# Giving more than one file allows the code to search which one contains the right
# coordinates (if a any) for the data that is being loaded
