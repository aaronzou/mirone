function data = csv2cell(fname)
% CSV2CELL - parses a CSV file into an NxM cell array, where N is the number
% of lines in file and M the number of fields in the longest.
%
% All fields from the CSV file are returned as strings. If the file contains lines
% with different numbers of fields, the empty fields appear as empties, [], in the output data.
