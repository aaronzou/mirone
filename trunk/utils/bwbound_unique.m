function B = bwbound_unique(B)
% Remove duplicate points from the output of BWBOUNDARIES
%
% When bwboundaries vectorize raster lines it returns vectors that go arround the raster line.
% This results in duplicated points which screw up further computations relying on polyline uiqueness.
% To complicate things further, the vector lines do not always start at one of the line ends.
% This function tries to remove the duplicates and re-order vertex so that we have a decent line.
