function [chunk_s,chunk] = tile(m,height,skirt)
% TILE chunks the 1:m vector into a nx2 matrix. Each line contains the indexes
% of successif [(height*n_chunk - 2) (height*n_chunk + 2)]. SKIRT is the overlapping 
% zone between adjacent chunks.
% This function is used to split a mxn matrix in horizontal tiles of height 'height', but
% with an overlaping zone. The reason I wrote this is to deal with the Matlab voracity
% for RAM. So instead of calling extremelly memory consumption routines (like surfnorm
% used in illumination) with the full matrix, I can call it several times (one for
% each tile).
% CHUNK_S contains the indexes of the successive chunks including the overlaping zone
% CHUNK   contains the indexes of CHUNK_S that do not overlap when put side-by-side
% (or vertically) to reconstruc the hole image.
% Example:      [xx yy] = tile(402,100,2);
% produces the following result
% xx =   1     102      yy =    1   100
%        99    202              3   102  
%        199   302              3   102
%        299   402              3   104
